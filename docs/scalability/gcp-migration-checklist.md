- [ ] Implement global load balancing

### [ ] Monitoring & Observability
- [ ] Set up Cloud Monitoring (metrics, logs, traces)
- [ ] Configure uptime checks and alerting
- [ ] Set up log-based metrics and dashboards
- [ ] Implement distributed tracing

## Phase 4: Migration Execution (Weeks 6-7)

### [ ] Data Migration
- [ ] Perform full database migration with minimal downtime
- [ ] Validate data integrity and consistency
- [ ] Update DNS records for zero-downtime cutover
- [ ] Configure database connection strings

### [ ] Application Migration

### [ ] Testing & Validation
- [ ] Perform comprehensive testing in staging environment
- [ ] Load test with simulated 10k concurrent users
- [ ] Validate API response times (< 2 seconds)
- [ ] Test failover and disaster recovery procedures

## Phase 5: Production Deployment (Week 8)

### [ ] Go-Live Preparation
- [ ] Final security review and penetration testing
- [ ] Performance benchmarking and optimization
- [ ] Documentation updates and runbooks
- [ ] Team training and handover

### [ ] Production Cutover
- [ ] Schedule maintenance window
- [ ] Execute blue-green deployment
- [ ] Monitor system health during cutover
- [ ] Validate all critical functionality

### [ ] Post-Migration Validation
- [ ] Monitor performance metrics for 24-48 hours
- [ ] Validate user experience and response times
- [ ] Check error rates and system stability
- [ ] Update monitoring dashboards and alerts

## Phase 6: Optimization & Scaling (Weeks 9-12)

### [ ] Performance Tuning
- [ ] Analyze production metrics and bottlenecks
- [ ] Optimize database queries and indexing
- [ ] Fine-tune auto-scaling policies
- [ ] Implement advanced caching strategies

### [ ] Advanced Features
- [ ] Set up multi-region deployment
- [ ] Implement database sharding if needed
- [ ] Configure advanced security policies
- [ ] Set up automated backup and recovery

### [ ] Monitoring Enhancement
- [ ] Implement advanced alerting and notifications
- [ ] Set up performance regression testing
- [ ] Create capacity planning dashboards
- [ ] Implement predictive scaling

## Risk Mitigation

### High Risk Items
- [ ] Database migration downtime (mitigation: blue-green deployment)
- [ ] API endpoint changes (mitigation: backward compatibility)
- [ ] Performance regression (mitigation: comprehensive testing)
- [ ] Cost overruns (mitigation: budget monitoring)

### Rollback Plan
- [ ] Document rollback procedures for each phase
- [ ] Set up automated rollback capabilities
- [ ] Test rollback procedures in staging
- [ ] Define rollback triggers and criteria

## Success Criteria

- [ ] All API responses < 2 seconds (95% percentile)
- [ ] Support 10,000+ concurrent users
- [ ] 99.9% uptime SLA achieved
- [ ] Zero data loss during migration
- [ ] Cost within budgeted amounts
- [ ] All monitoring and alerting functional
