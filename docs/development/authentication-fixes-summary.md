# Authentication Fixes Summary

## Issues Identified

1. **Solana Authentication Endpoint**: Used `getUserById` with public key directly, which was incorrect
2. **Session Generation**: Used magic link generation for Solana auth, which was inappropriate
3. **Token Verification**: Authentication middleware and WebSocket token verification did not properly handle "Bearer " token prefix consistently
4. **Frontend Handling**: Solana login button did not handle the new authentication response format with access and refresh tokens
5. **Error Handling**: User context had inadequate error handling for authentication responses

## Fixes Implemented

### 1. Solana Authentication Endpoint (`server/server.js`)
- Updated to check user existence by email (using publicKey@solana.wallet)
- Create new user with placeholder password if not existing
- Generate an access token by signing in with email and placeholder password
- Return user info along with access and refresh tokens

### 2. Authentication Middleware (`server/server.js`)
- Fixed to properly extract and verify JWT tokens from "Bearer " prefixed headers
- Improved error handling and logging

### 3. WebSocket Authentication (`server/websocket.js`)
- Fixed to properly verify access tokens with Supabase
- Handle token prefix correctly
- Added proper error logging for invalid tokens

### 4. Solana Login Button (`components/solana-login-button.tsx`)
- Updated to send Solana auth data to backend
- Receive access and refresh tokens
- Set Supabase session with returned tokens
- Handle authentication errors appropriately

### 5. User Context (`contexts/user-context.tsx`)
- Improved error handling for authentication responses
- Fixed TypeScript errors related to Supabase auth response types
- Better feedback for login failures

## Testing

All authentication flows have been verified:
- Email/password login
- Solana wallet login
- Token verification on API endpoints
- Token verification on WebSocket connections
- Session persistence and user context updates

## Security Considerations

- Placeholder password for Solana wallet users should be secured or replaced in production
- Consider implementing actual signature verification for Solana login messages
- Token expiration and refresh mechanisms are properly handled

## Next Steps

- Implement actual signature verification for Solana login messages
- Improve security of placeholder passwords
- Add more comprehensive error handling and user feedback
- Consider adding rate limiting to authentication endpoints
