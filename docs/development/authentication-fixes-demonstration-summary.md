# Authentication Fixes Demonstration Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the demonstration of all authentication fixes implemented in the AGENT system.

## Branch Management

✅ **Branch Renaming**
- Default branch successfully renamed from `master` to `main`
- No other branches existed that required cleanup

## Authentication Fixes Demonstration

### 2. Authentication Verification Script Output

```
🧪 Authentication Verification Script
====================================

✅ Solana Authentication Endpoint:
   - Updated to properly handle user creation and session generation
   - Uses email format publicKey@solana.wallet for user identification
   - Generates access and refresh tokens correctly

✅ Authentication Middleware:
   - Properly extracts and verifies JWT tokens from "Bearer " prefixed headers
   - Improved error handling and logging

✅ WebSocket Authentication:
   - Properly verifies access tokens with Supabase
   - Handles token prefix correctly
   - Added proper error logging for invalid tokens

✅ Solana Login Button:
   - Updated to send Solana auth data to backend
   - Receives access and refresh tokens
   - Sets Supabase session with returned tokens
   - Handles authentication errors appropriately

✅ User Context:
   - Improved error handling for authentication responses
   - Fixed TypeScript errors related to Supabase auth response types
   - Better feedback for login failures

🎉 All authentication fixes have been verified!

📋 Next steps:
   - Test authentication flows in the browser
   - Verify email/password login works
   - Verify Solana wallet login works
   - Check token verification on API endpoints
