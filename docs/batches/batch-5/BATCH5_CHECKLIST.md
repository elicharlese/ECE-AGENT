- [ ] All patch checklists in this batch are done (Patch 5: Chat UI Modernization)
- [ ] Feature-supporting patches merged to main
- [ ] Kilo deployment succeeded (record via `/release-sync`)
- [ ] UI/UX sign-off: professional theme applied consistently across chat surfaces
- [ ] Accessibility: WCAG AA contrast, focus states, keyboard navigation
- [ ] Visual regression snapshots captured and reviewed
- [ ] E2E happy paths green (message send, thread switch, menu interactions)
- [ ] Performance unchanged or improved (FCP/TTI unaffected)

## Scope
Professional, sleek theme pass with a focus on the chat experience. Establish tokens for color, typography, spacing; update chat components to modern visual styles; ensure dark/light parity.

## Success Criteria
- Consistent application of design tokens across `components/chat/`
- Modernized chat bubbles, composer, toolbar, thread list
- Smooth micro-interactions (hover/press/focus) and subtle motion
- No regressions in a11y, performance, or functionality
