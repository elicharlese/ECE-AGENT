# Summary — Batch 5: Professional UI Theme Update

This batch delivers a modern, sleek UI across the chat experience with a focus on professional aesthetics, accessibility, and performance. It introduces foundational design tokens (color, typography, spacing, radii, elevation), updates core chat components, and ensures dark/light parity.

## Scope
- Establish theme tokens and Tailwind utilities to standardize look-and-feel
- Refresh chat UI: conversation list, header toolbars, message bubbles, composer, menus
- A11y: focus states, keyboard navigation, WCAG AA contrast
- Subtle motion and micro-interactions consistent with a professional product
- Visual regressions and E2E coverage for primary chat flows

## Deliverables
- Design tokens integrated and documented
- Updated `components/chat/*` with theme application
- Updated tests (unit + e2e) and screenshots for visual regression checks

## Risks / Mitigations
- Style regressions → snapshot & E2E checks, incremental rollout behind a flag
- Contrast issues → tooling pass on colors + manual QA in dark/light modes

## SLA / Timeline
- Implementation: 3–5 days
- QA/Polish: 1–2 days
