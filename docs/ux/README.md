# UX Documentation

This folder contains user experience research, design decisions, and information architecture documentation for the ECE-AGENT application.

## Structure

- **design-decision-log.md** - Atomic design decisions with Mobbin research references
- **ia.md** - Information architecture and navigation model
- **mobbin-research-workflow.md** - Process for UX research and pattern selection
- **references.md** - Mobbin pattern references and implementation mapping

## Current Status (Updated 2025-01-30)

### Information Architecture

The current IA reflects a messaging-focused application structure:

- **Primary Routes**: `/`, `/auth`, `/messages`, `/profile`, `/test`
- **Navigation Model**: Simple top-level navigation with responsive design
- **Layout Patterns**: Shell with responsive sidebar, mobile-first approach

### Design System Status

- **Components**: React + Tailwind CSS with Radix UI primitives
- **Tokens**: Minimal token system using CSS variables
- **Patterns**: Message bubbles, responsive layouts, authentication flows
- **Testing Interface**: New `/test` route for API validation

### UX Research Workflow

The Mobbin research workflow is established but needs application to current messaging interface:

1. **Current Focus**: Messaging and communication features
2. **Research Gaps**: Dashboard patterns, admin interfaces, complex data views
3. **Implementation**: React components with Tailwind styling

## Recent Updates

### Test Interface (2025-01-30)
- Added comprehensive API testing interface at `/test`
- Real-time connection status for all endpoints
- Categorized by Auth, Data, Payment, Integration, Media APIs

### Authentication Flow
- Supabase-based authentication with OAuth support
- Responsive login forms with proper error handling
- Secure session management and redirects

## Next Steps

1. **Update IA documentation** to reflect current messaging-focused architecture
2. **Apply Mobbin research** to messaging interface patterns
3. **Document current component patterns** in design decision log
4. **Expand UX research** for admin and testing interfaces

## Implementation Notes

- All patterns follow accessibility guidelines with keyboard navigation
- Responsive design with mobile-first approach
- No proprietary assets copied; all designs are original
- Component library built on Radix UI primitives with Tailwind styling
