# Feature-Based Patch Organization

This directory contains patches organized by feature rather than sequential numbering. Each subdirectory represents a distinct feature from the END_GOAL.md requirements.

Note: Feature directories live under `docs/patches/patch_feature/`.

## Feature Directories

- `admin_login` - Authentication and admin security features
- `responsive_ui` - UI components and responsive design
- `mobile_desktop_consistency` - Cross-platform design consistency
- `nx_routing` - Nx workspace and routing configuration
- `test_coverage` - Testing implementation and expansion
- `zod_validation` - Runtime validation with Zod schemas
- `ci_cd_deployment` - Deployment pipeline and automation
- `documentation_mapping` - Documentation organization and tracking
- `keyboard_shortcuts` - Global hotkeys, command palette, and help overlay

## Organization Benefits

1. **Clear Feature Ownership**: Each feature directory can be owned by a specific team or developer
2. **Easier Navigation**: Find all documentation related to a specific feature in one place
3. **Better Traceability**: Map patch files directly to END_GOAL.md requirements
4. **Parallel Development**: Multiple features can be developed simultaneously without conflicts
5. **Focused Reviews**: Code reviews can be more targeted to specific feature areas

## How to Use

1. Identify which feature your patch relates to (see `docs/patches/patch_feature/`)
2. Create your patch documentation in the appropriate feature directory under `docs/patches/patch_feature/`
3. Follow the standard patch guidelines for file naming and content structure
4. Reference the END_GOAL.md requirements in your patch documentation
