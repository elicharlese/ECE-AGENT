# Patch 1 Summary â€” Immersive Chat (3D Headset View)

## Problem
Users want an immersive 3D headset view to interact with chat content in a spatial UI.

## Solution
- Added a small toggle button to the chat window that switches between the standard list and a 3D-like view.
- Implemented `Headset3DView` using CSS 3D transforms (no heavy runtime deps) to keep initial footprint minimal and tests stable.
- When 3D mode is active, standard message list and input are hidden; users can pan the camera and click on message cards in the 3D space.

## Changes
- `docs/patches/immersive_chat/README.md`
- `docs/patches/immersive_chat/patch-1/PATCH_CHECKLIST.md`
- `docs/patches/immersive_chat/patch-1/PATCH_SUMMARY.md`
- `components/chat/Headset3DView.tsx` (new)
- `components/chat/chat-window.tsx` (add toggle + mode)

## Impact
- Default experience unchanged.
- New optional 3D mode available; accessible labels provided.
- No additional dependencies introduced in this patch, ensuring CI stability.

## Testing
- Full Jest suite passes. No new tests added in this patch to avoid introducing flaky canvas interactions; plan to add basic toggle visibility tests in a follow-up.
