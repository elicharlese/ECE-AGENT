## Implementation Notes

1. Each feature directory contains all relevant documentation from patches that contributed to that feature
2. Feature documentation has been consolidated under `docs/patches/patch_feature/<feature>/` while original `patch-#` directories remain for chronological history
3. This mapping allows for feature-based development and documentation organization
4. Future patches should use `patch_feature/<feature>/patch-<n>/` with `PATCH_CHECKLIST.md` and `PATCH_SUMMARY.md`
