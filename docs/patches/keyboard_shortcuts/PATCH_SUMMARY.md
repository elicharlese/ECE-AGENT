# Patch Summary — Keyboard Shortcuts

## Problem
Navigation and accessibility were limited; users lacked a fast way to open commands, discover shortcuts, and jump between key routes without the mouse.

## Solution
- Implemented global keyboard shortcuts via a dedicated provider and reusable hook.
- Added a Command Palette modal (Cmd/Ctrl+K) and a Keyboard Shortcuts Help modal (Shift+?).
- Implemented go-to sequences: `g` `m` → `/messages`, `g` `h` → `/`.

## Changes
- `hooks/use-hotkeys.ts` (new): Reusable hook for single-combo hotkeys.
- `components/hotkeys/HotkeysProvider.tsx` (new): Global key listeners + sequence handling.
- `components/hotkeys/CommandPalette.tsx` (new): UI to search/execute quick actions.
- `components/hotkeys/ShortcutsHelp.tsx` (new): Modal listing available shortcuts.
- `app/providers.tsx`: Wraps children with `HotkeysProvider` so shortcuts are global.

## Impact
- Minimal performance overhead (single global listener and small dialogs).
- Improves discoverability and navigation efficiency.

## Testing & Validation
- Manual verification in development.
- Fresh `next build` to verify bundle succeeds.
- Follow-up task to add unit tests for `useHotkeys` and sequence logic.

## Shortcuts Implemented
- Cmd/Ctrl+K → Open Command Palette
- Shift+? → Open Shortcuts Help
- g m → Navigate to `/messages`
- g h → Navigate to `/`

## Next Steps
- Expand Command Palette with more actions (search, navigation, quick toggles).
- Add unit tests and storybook docs for hotkeys components.
