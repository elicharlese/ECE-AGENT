# Required: Advanced consensus architecture
class ConsensusReasoner:
    def __init__(self):
        self.neural_modules = []  # Multiple specialized reasoning units
        self.consensus_mechanism = BrainInspiredConsensus()
        self.conflict_resolution = AdvancedConflictResolver()

    def reason(self, input_data):
        # Parallel processing across multiple reasoning modules
        module_outputs = [module.process(input_data) for module in self.neural_modules]
        consensus_output = self.consensus_mechanism.resolve(module_outputs)
