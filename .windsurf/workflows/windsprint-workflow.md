# Windsprint Workflow

Launches the full patch→batch spiral: scaffolds docs, configures CI/CD, plans features, develops, deploys via Kilo, and spins up the next cycle—automatically looping until `END_GOAL.md` is fully checked.

## Steps

### 1. Bootstrap Templates (✅ Completed)
- Scaffolds docs/guidelines.md, END_GOAL.md, README.md + optional .windsurfrules.md
- Commits with tag v0.0.1

### 2. Pipeline Setup (✅ Completed) 
- Reads .vercel/project.json and existing secrets
- Writes .github/workflows/kilo-pipeline.yml
- Commits + tags (e.g. v0.1.0) for Kilo CI/CD activation

### 3. Nx Monorepo Setup (✅ Completed)
- Initialized Nx workspace with React TypeScript
- Added Expo mobile app for cross-platform support
- Created desktop app structure with Electron
- Implemented shared UI components with React + Tailwind CSS

### 4. Architecture Implementation (✅ Completed)
- Created libs/shared-ui with responsive components
- Implemented Button, Card, Layout components
- Added useResponsive hook for breakpoint management
- Set up desktop app with Electron main process

### 5. CI/CD Pipeline (✅ Completed)
- Created Kilo pipeline with GitHub Actions
- Configured Nx build targets for web, mobile, desktop
- Set up Vercel deployment integration
- Added project configurations for all apps

### 6. Development Cycle Status
All major components are now in place:
- ✅ Nx monorepo with web, mobile, desktop apps
- ✅ Shared UI library with responsive components
- ✅ CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions
- ✅ Desktop app with Electron
- ✅ Mobile app with Expo
- ✅ TypeScript configuration
- ✅ Project structure following user rules

## Next Steps for Full Production Readiness

1. **Install remaining dependencies** (when network allows)
2. **Run build verification** across all apps
3. **Set up environment variables** for deployment
4. **Configure Vercel project** for web app deployment
5. **Test mobile app** on iOS/Android simulators
6. **Package desktop app** for distribution

The Nx monorepo now supports:
- **Web**: Next.js with existing features
- **Mobile**: Expo with React Native
- **Desktop**: Electron with TypeScript
- **Shared**: Common UI components and hooks
